Alternatively, it may require extensive cardiovascular and neurological investigations \nand referral to several specialists. People should \nbe advised not to drive until the mechanism is \nascertained and the corresponding standard met.\nSome drivers may attribute a crash or driving \nmishap to a ‘blackout’ to excuse an event \nthat occurred for some other reason such as \ninattention or distraction (e.g. a mobile phone \nconversation).

However, vasovagal \nsyncope may also result from other causes \nthat are not so benign.

Effects of cardiovascular \nconditions on driving\nCardiovascular conditions may affect the ability \nto drive safely due to sudden incapacity such \nas from a heart attack or arrhythmia. They may \nalso affect concentration and the ability to \ncontrol a vehicle due to the onset of chest pain, \npalpitations or breathlessness.\nCardiovascular conditions may also have end-\norgan effects such as on the brain (stroke), \nthe extremities and the eyes. The relevant \nchapters should be referred to for advice on the \nassessment and requirements for these effects \n(refer to section 6. Neurological conditions  and \nsection 10.

The impairments are commonly \naccompanied, and occasionally preceded, \nby deterioration in emotional control, social \nbehaviour or motivation.\nDisease pathology without cognitive impairment \ncan be seen in preclinical dementia, while \na slight but noticeable decline in some \ncognitive functions may indicate mild cognitive \nimpairment (MCI) or prodromal dementia. \nAlzheimer’s disease is the most common form \nof dementia and may contribute to 60–70",

Psychogenic nonepileptic \nseizures8,9\nSome transient episodes of apparently impaired \nconsciousness, awareness or motor control \nresemble epileptic seizures or syncope, \nyet have a psychological cause. These \nepisodes are usually termed psychogenic \nnonepileptic seizures (PNES), although they are \nsometimes known as dissociative, functional \nor pseudoseizures. Most patients diagnosed \nwith PNES self-report loss of responsiveness \nor loss of awareness that may place them \nat an increased risk of causing a motor \nvehicle accident.\nThe safety risk is sufficiently low after a three-\nmonth period, with no further psychogenic \nseizures, to allow a return to driving. People with \nactive PNES should generally not be allowed to \ndrive if they lose awareness or responsiveness \nwith their psychogenic seizures, have a history \nof seizure related injuries, or if the semiology \nsuggests that ability to drive would be impaired \nduring a psychogenic seizure.",

In 2018, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported “19.2 million  registered motor  vehicles  in Australia”  (Australian  Bureau of Statistics, 2018a,  p. 1) \nwhich  is expected to grow  based on previous data between 2017 and 2018 outlining a growth rate of 2.1 \npercent (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2018a). This data highlights that a large proportion of the Austr alian population drive a car, and there are several key reasons for this.  \nResearch has shown that  driving is  an extremely valued occupation,  and this  is often  not because \nof the task of driving itself but more about what driving enables people to do (Dic kerson et al.,",

For example, driving allows people to access their local shopping centre, to socialise with friends and access services and healthcare facilities. Driving is particularly important for those adults living in rural and remote areas, where access to public transport is limited (Liddle et al., 2008; Unsworth et al., \n2020). This can make independent living extremely difficult such as, accessing the local supermarket for \nfood or the pharmacy  for medication,  and often  an increased reliance on family  or friends  for assistance is \nneeded causing significant carer burden. A study by Fricke and Unsworth (2001) explored time use and the importance of occupations among older adults. It was found that 90.9% reported transportation use \nas very important, and 87.5% reported that driving a  car was also very important. Similarly, a subsequent",

(2013) found that 87% of people, and their carers, rated driving most frequently \nas a meaningful occupation.  \nGiven that driving  brings significant purpose and meaning in life, the potential consequences of \ndriving cessation can be shattering. Driving cessation can occur in either of two ways; voluntarily or a result of the licensing authority revoking the licence (Liddle et al., 2012; Unsworth et al., 2020). Research has shown that the cessation of driving is often encompassed by a loss of access to the community, and \nloss of various roles or identities (Liddle et al., 2012). As a result of reduced independence, freedom of \ncontrol  and loss of social interactions,  high rates  of serious  mental  health conditions  occur  for not only the \nperson who has ceased driving but often their dependent carers as well (Dickerson et al., 2011; Liddle et \nal., 2012).

The effects of stroke can include weakness in arms  and legs, and difficulty with \nspeaking, thinking and vision. Stroke occurs in approximately 60,000 people in Australia each \nyear , and stroke is Aus tralia’s second largest killer and cause of disability  (National Stroke \nFoundation, 2010b ). A major predictor of a patient’s return to independence post -stroke , and \nhence quality of life , is the ability to drive  (Poole, Chaudry, & Jay, 2008 ).

A decision tree  is suggested to build \npatient -centred  procedures for return ing to driving along  the post-stroke  recovery trajectory .   \n \nPart one reviews  literature on  the return to driving  process post -stroke and identifies  gaps in \nknowledge .  The stroke recovery trajectory ’s three main phases of recovery ( acute, \nrehabilitation and community care ) are outlined  and act  as a framework for  the thesis \nstructur e.

Independence was found to be the primary \nmotivator in stroke survivors’ decision s about fitness to drive.  However, during the acute \nphase s troke survivors were focused on their phys ical recovery, not  returning to  driving .  \nStudy participants  had little knowledge of return to driving procedures or legislation , despite \ninformation being  available .  Gender differences were  apparent  in factors affecting the return \nto driving decision making .   \n \nThe second study  examines  the psychometric property of practice effect on the Useful Field \nof View (UFOV , Ball & Owsley, 1993 ) a pre-drivi ng screening assessment .

Hence the decision to relinquish driving needs to be carefully considered.   \nUnderstanding key f actors that affect an older driver ’s decision  to relinquish their driver’s \nlicence  has been pr eviously identified as important to assist health  care professionals in \ncommunicating with older people about their driving ability , and to help older people to \nrespond positively to the consequences of driving reduction o r eve n cessation (Ragland, \nSataria no & MacLeod , 2004).  The findings from previous studies point to potentially \nsignificant differences between men and women, with older women being more likely to \nadmit to their own declining driving abilities than older men.  Men may be more likely to \nexternalise the decision to relinquish th eir driv er’s licenc e as primarily due to medical \nreasons , as opposed to their own innate declining driving abilities or an increased cr ash risk \n(Hakamies -Blomqvist & Siren, 2003 ; Hakamies -Blomqvist & Wahlstrom, 1998 ).",

DCE has its \norigins in mathematical psychology and has been widely applied in marketing, tra nsport and \nenvironmental economics and more recently within h ealth economics (Louviere, Hensher & \nSwait , 2000).

Stepwise logistic regression showed that the presence of \ninstrumental sequelae, mainly aphasia, was the best predictor of fitness-to-drive recommendations. \nConclusions: The post-stroke time interval and the presence of instrumental sequelae explained the difference \nbetween patients recommended as fit-to-drive and unfit-to-drive. Furthermore, aphasia was found be the best \npredictor of a fitness-to-drive recommendation. It is possible that aphasia impacts the understanding of in-\nstructions during on-road testing. These findings emphasize the need for a standardized multi-professional \nfitness-to-drive assessment, since the determinants of fitness-to-drive recommendation differ between studies.   \nIntroduction \nEvery year in France, strokes affect 140 000 people, and are the first",

According to several \nstudies, post-stroke aphasia is very frequent and involves more than just \nloss of speech.15 Aphasia can also affect language comprehension and \nexpression. Consequently, this disorder can be assumed to have an \nimpact on the understanding of instructions given by the on-road \nassessor during driving, and on the recognition of traffic signs.16 This \nhypothesis is consistent with the results of a study that showed that \npatients with aphasia had significantly lower scores in traffic sign \nrecognition and comprehension of written and spoken descriptions of \ntraffic signs than patients without aphasia.17",
